# police_call_data

The R file contains a script to scrape police call data from Eugene and Springfield, OR from www.registerguard.com (our local newspaper).

Eugene: http://projects.registerguard.com/police/eugene/2022/feb/
Springfield: http://projects.registerguard.com/police/springfield/2022/feb/

If you click on specific dates on these pages, there will be more information. Exact times, crimes and addresses are included. However at this time, I have only scraped the total number of calls per day. I may include the other details in the future along with a Python version.

This is the file I originally posted on Kaggle modified to scrape data through the end of 2021. CSV outputs for both cities are included.

***UPDATE 8/10/2022***

Registerguard.com has removed the police call logs (not sure when).
